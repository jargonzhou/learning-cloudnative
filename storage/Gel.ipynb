    "> It inherits the strengths of SQL databases: type safety, performance, reliability, and transactionality. But instead of modeling data in a relational (tabular) way, Gel represents data with **object types** containing **properties** and **links** to other objects. It leverages this object-oriented model to provide a superpowered query language that solves some of SQL's biggest usability problems."
