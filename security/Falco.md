* https://falco.org/

> Falco is **a cloud native runtime security tool for Linux operating systems**. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time.
>
> At its core, Falco is **a kernel monitoring and detection agent that observes events**, such as syscalls, based on custom **rules**. Falco can enhance these events by integrating metadata from the container runtime and Kubernetes. The collected events can be analyzed off-host in SIEM or data lake systems.
